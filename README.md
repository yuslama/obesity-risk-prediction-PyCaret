# Obesity Risk Prediction

Welcome to the Obesity Risk Prediction project! This project aims to predict obesity risk in individuals based on various factors related to their eating habits, physical condition, and lifestyle. The dataset used for training and testing was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Obesity or Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk dataset. The competition objective is to predict the class of NObeyesdad (Obesity Level) for each individual in the test dataset.

## Dataset Information

The dataset includes data from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, containing 17 attributes and 2111 records. The attributes include features such as Gender, Age, Height, Weight, family_history_with_overweight, FAVC (Frequency of High Caloric Food Consumption), FCVC (Frequency of Vegetable Consumption), and more. The target variable, NObeyesdad, represents the obesity level, categorized as Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II, and Obesity Type III.

## Objective

To predict obesity risk in individuals, which is related to cardiovascular disease. Participants are encouraged to explore the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize feature distributions, and develop machine learning models to predict the obesity level.

## Classification using PyCaret

This project utilizes PyCaret, an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python, for easy and efficient classification modeling. PyCaret automates various steps in the machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretation, allowing for rapid experimentation and deployment of machine learning models.
